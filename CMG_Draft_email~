Dear fellow students,

We would like to invite you to join a newly founded Problem Solving Maths Group.

The purpose of our group will be discovering not very well known (but powerful) mathematical concepts and techniques, in preparation for international mathematical competitions - such as the IMC in Bulgaria, the Putnam competition in the US*, Google Code Jams, UK Maths Jams, and Project Euler problems.

We will have weekly informal sessions, each with predetermined topic, where we will learn how to apply techniques and concepts described in a hand-out on a given set of problems (consisting of all difficulty levels), all in a friendly atmosphere of like-minded people.  What else we might do each week will depend on who comes along and what they are motivated to do!

If you feel like this is something for you, please fill in the following form with times that you are available during the week
and also drop your e-mail in there: http://goo.gl/forms/QZlBg8qKjb

We will commence with first session during week 3 which will look into very useful problem solving strategy called Extreme Principle.

You will be notified via e-mail with all necessary information about time and place (including materials about Extreme Principle) soon enough.  Dr. David Jordan, lecturer for the Proofs and Problem Solving course in the Spring, has agreed to be our faculty advisor.

Note: this group is mostly intended for undergraduate students.

Best,
Miroslav Stankovic and Marko Puza

*we cannot officially participate in the Putnam, but can take the exam on the day of, and Dr. Jordan will grade it for us.
