\section{Theory}

The \emph{Extreme principle}\footnote{https://brilliant.org/wiki/extremal-principle/} is a methodology, a useful problem solving tactics, that focuses on finding a solution with some extreme property among all possible candidates. Very often, this means finding the smallest or largest value. Afterwards, the extreme solution is used to construct a proof while making use of the simplified conditions that it provides.


\section{Examples}

\begin{theorem}
There are $n$ points given on a plane. \textbf{Each} three of them determine a triangle whose area is at most $1$. Show, that all points lie inside a triangle whose area is at most $4$.  
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
From among all triples of points, let $(A, B, C)$ be the triple that determines triangle with the largest area. Now consider line $l_{A}$ parallel to $BC$.
\end{proof}


\section{Problems}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{There are $n$ points on a plane. No line passes through exactly two of those points. Prove that all $n$ points lie on a line.}
\end{enumerate}
