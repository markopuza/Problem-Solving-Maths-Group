Ex. 1:
	circle, sphere or any n-sphere, equation holds.
Ex. 2:
	no, the picture depicts case N = (2.5)^2
Point of these two exercise is to show that the equation
indeed holds in usual understaning of dimension

Ex. 3:
	after n iterations there is T_n = 3x4^(n-1) sides
	each side has length 1/3^n
	it has infinite length.
Ex. 4:
	use T_n (number of sides after n iterations)
	to construct the expression for the A_n (area after
	n iterations). Then take it to the limit.
Ex. 5:
	Zero volume. Good way to do this is to count the volume
	of the holes, it will be 1 in the limit.
	Surface area is infinite.
	after n iterations, S_n = 2*(20/9)^n + 4*(8/9)^n
	!! Calculating the surface area is quite hard, maybe you can
	skip it. !!
	Dimension: log(20) / log(3)
Ex. 6:
	Surface area is sqrt(3) (when the side of the original tetrahedron is 1)
	Volume is 0.
	Dimension is 2.
Pr. 1:
	There is a bijection between ternary digits (0,2) and numbers in binary
	representation using digits (0,1)
	-> for example 0.0220  <->  0.0110
Ex. 7:
	Should look something like this:
	A
	AB
	ABA
	ABAAB
	When you join the parents with its children, the picture is self-similar
	when rooted in arbitrary A
Ex. 8:
	[-2,0.25]
Pr. 2:
	(possibly infinite) intersection of closed sets is closed
	polynomial functions are closed.
	write M = {c where |c| <= 2} *intersects* {c where |c^2 + c| <= 2} *intersects* {c where |(c^2 + c)^2 + c| <= 2} ...

Ex. 9:
	for seed z_0 = 0, c is in M precisely when it will not diverge, by definition.
	thus the Julia set J_c will be connected
Ex. 10:
	This is precisely ex. 8 (to check the understaning). Thus [-2, 0.25]
Ex. 11:
	Just show it :)
