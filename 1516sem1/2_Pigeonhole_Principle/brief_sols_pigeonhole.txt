_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1.	Pigeons: Subsets of S (2^n)
	Holes: Possible sums of any subset of S (less than n^3)
	-> Work with all subsets (not necessarily disjoint), construct the disjoint sets later

2.	Pigeons: Points (9)
	Holes: Possible combinations of parities of coordinates (8)

3.	Pigeons: Sheep (n)
	Holes: Numbers of comrades of each sheep (0,..,n-1)
	-> Consider cases where there is a sheep with no comrades and where not

4.	Pigeons: Integers (n + 2)
	Holes: Groups od remainders mod 2n ({0}, {n}, {i, 2n - i} for i = 1,2,...,n-  --> there is n + 1 such groups altogether)
	-> Suppose there are no two whose difference is a multiple of 2n and prove that there must be two
	   whose sum is divisible by 2n

5.	Pigeons: Points (5)
	Holes: Divide 2x2 square into 1x1 parts (4)

6.	Pigeons: Dominoes
	Holes: Colors of squares on which the dominoes are placed
	-> Count how many white and how many black squares are occupied by dominoes. After having placed 
	   each individual domino, what can you say about these numbers? 

7.	This problem was originally featured in Putnam competition, 2000-B6
	For each point P in S, let s_p denote the set of n points a distance 2 from P (these are precisely the points
	that differ in one coordinate from P).
	Now note that every two points of s_p are of the same distance (are equidistant). Thus we now need only to show that there exists
	a point P (not necessarily from S) for which s_p contains at least three points that are from S.
	Pigeons: points (each point is part of n sets s_p, since it has n coordinates -> we need to put each point in some hole n times.
		     -> more than n * 2^(n+1)/n  ==  more than 2^(n+1) placements)
	Holes: sets s_p - one for each point (2^n)

8.	Pigeons: Rooks (33)
	Holes: Diagonals of the chessboard (not only main diagonal; also not continuous ones - see example below) (8)
	Example: Here the #'s denote one diagonal
			 --#------
			 -#-------
			 #-------#
			 -------#-
			 ------#--
			 -----#---
			 ----#----
			 ---#-----

9.	Pigeons: Numbers (n^2 + 1)
	Holes: For each number consider length of the longest decreasing subsequence which starts at that number 
		   (these must be < n, when we seek contratidiction and also >= 1). Consider holes to be these lengths (n of them)
	-> By contradiction. Pigeonhole principle says that there must be n + 1 numbers for which the lengths of the longest subsequences
	   starting with them are equal.  Can you now say that the sequence of these numbers is monotonic? 

10. This is an instance of the zero-sum problem. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_problem )
	We will prove a more general statement: From any set of (2n - 1) integers we can choose n whose sum is divisible by n.
	High level proof construction: 
		-> Prove that the statement holds for all values where n is equal to some prime number (harder part)
		-> Prove by induction that if statement holds for n = k and n = l, it will also hold for n = kl
	The whole proof can be found for example in this paper: https://www.physics.harvard.edu/uploads/files/undergrad/probweek/sol80.pdf


11. This problem was originally featured in the national round of Slovak Maths Olympiad (2012/3)
	You can proceed (each step is equivalent to the previous one) as follows:
	-> original inequality
	-> 100|(u - v)(1 - uv)| <= (1 + u^2)(1 + v^2)	(push inside the abs.)
	-> 100|u - v - u^2v + uv^2| <= (1 + u^2)(1 + v^2)  (distribute)
	-> |u(1 + v^2) - v(1 + u^2)| <= (1 + u^2)(1 + v^2) / 100  (divide)
	-> |u/(1 + u^2) - v/(1 + v^2)| <= 1/100  (divide by positive number)

	Now, consider all values of function f(x) = x/(1 + x^2). We must have -1/2 <= f(x) <= 1/2 for all x (convince yourself)
	At this step, we can use the Pigeonhole principle:
	Pigeons: Numbers (101)
	Holes: Intervals of length 1/100 between -1/2 and 1/2 (100)
