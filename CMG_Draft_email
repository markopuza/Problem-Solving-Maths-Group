Dear fellow students,

for whoever might be interested, we would like to invite you to join a newly founded Competetive Maths Group.

The purpose of our group will range from preparation for international and national mathematical competitions 
all over to discovering not very well known (but powerful) mathematical concepts.

We will have weekly informal sessions, each with predetermined topic, where we will learn how to apply techniques
and concepts described in a hand-out on a given set of problems (consisting of all difficulty levels), all in a friendly 
atmosphere of like-minded people.

If you feel like this is something for you, please fill in the following form with times that you are available during the week
and also drop your e-mail in there: http://goo.gl/forms/jO7FjePqGv

We will commence with first session during week 3 which will look into very useful problem solving strategy called Extreme Principle.
You will be notified via e-mail with all necessary information about time and place (including materials about Extreme Principle) soon enough.

Note: this group is mostly intended for undergraduate students.

Best,

Dr. David Jordan, Miroslav Stankovic and Marko Puza
