Dear fellow students,

We would like to invite you to join a newly founded Problem Solving Maths Group.

The purpose of our group is discovering not very well known (but powerful) mathematical concepts and techniques, mostly for fun but also in preparation for international mathematical competitions - such as the IMC in Bulgaria, the Putnam competition in the US*. We might possibly take a look at Google Code Jams, UK Maths Jams, and Project Euler problems in the future as well.

We hold weekly informal sessions, each with predetermined topic, where we learn how to apply techniques and concepts described in a hand-out on a given set of problems (consisting of all difficulty levels), all in a friendly atmosphere of like-minded people. What else we might do each week will depend on who comes along and what they are motivated to do! Dr. David Jordan, lecturer for the Proofs and Problem Solving course in the Spring, has agreed to be our faculty advisor.

We meet weekly on Tuesdays at 6:30 pm in the Appleton tower Mathsbase (room M3 on the mezzanine floor, next to the elevators).

If you feel like this is something for you**, just come and meet us. Also, drop your e-mail in the following form - you will receive the newsletters with relevant materials before every session: http://goo.gl/forms/QZlBg8qKjb

Should you plan to come this Tuesday (20/10/2015), please try to take a look at the 'Theory' and 'Examples' sections in the attached materials on Invariants - our current topic.

Best,
Miroslav Stankovic and Marko Puza

*we cannot officially participate in the Putnam, but can take the exam on the day of, and Dr. Jordan will grade it for us.
**the group is primarily intended for undergraduate students.
